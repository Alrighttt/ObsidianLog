//! Chunk references, headers, and the encrypted chunk body.
//!
//! A chunk is the unit written to storage: one compressed-then-encrypted blob of
//! log records for a `(service, time_window)`, plus a header carrying the
//! per-service hash-chain link and the AES-GCM nonce.
//!
//! ## Canonical hashing layout
//!
//! [`Chunk::hash_input`] returns the exact bytes that are SHA-256'd to produce a
//! chunk's hash. Those bytes are the header (which **includes** `prev_hash`)
//! followed by the ciphertext. The chunk's *own* hash is never part of this
//! input — it is computed from these bytes and stored separately (in the next
//! chunk's `prev_hash` and in the manifest). Because `prev_hash` is hashed,
//! tampering with the chain is detectable. The layout is fixed and big-endian;
//! see [`ChunkHeader::canonical_bytes`].
